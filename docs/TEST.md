# Testing

---
##Â Intro
In order to perform functional and performance testing, we use a dedicated VM.

    TODO: add test-tool VM in architecture and puppetise test-tool VM

On this VM, we install several tools:
* Rally: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rally
* RobotFramework: http://robotframework.org/
* SIPP http://sipp.sourceforge.net/



## Installation & Configuration

### Rally

* Log on the test-tool VM
* install rally (https://rally.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/step_0_installation.html)
* For Rally scenario, follow https://rally.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/step_1_setting_up_env_and_running_benchmark_from_samples.html
* For Tempest, follow the instructions https://www.mirantis.com/blog/rally-openstack-tempest-testing-made-simpler
* In first step Rally scenario were fine but Tempest scenarios failed due to configuration
Apply patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/163330/
```bash
pip uninstall rally && cd ./rally && python setup.py install
```

You shall be able to run Rally towards your OpenStack
