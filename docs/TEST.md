# Testing

---
##Â Intro
In order to perform functional and performance testing, we use a dedicated VM.

    TODO: add test-tool VM in architecture and puppetise test-tool VM

On this VM, we install several tools:
* [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rally Rally]
* [http://robotframework.org/ RobotFramework]
* [http://sipp.sourceforge.net/ SIPP]



## Installation & Configuration

### Rally

Log on the test-toll VM
Follow the instructions https://www.mirantis.com/blog/rally-openstack-tempest-testing-made-simpler/

In first step Rally scenario were fine but Tempest scenarios failed due to configuration
Apply patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/163330/
```bash
pip uninstall rally && cd ./rally && python setup.py install
```
You shall be able to run Rally towards your OpenStack
