2014-09-03 Release 2.0.0
Summary:

This is a fairly large rewrite of many parts of the mcollective module to
remove the management of activemq and rabbitmq (middleware) since this task
should be delegated to activemq/rabbitmq modules. See the examples/ directory
for example profiles to replicate previous configuration.

Backwards-incompatible Features:
- Removed the management of activemq and rabbitmq
- Removed the following parameters:
  - mcollective::middleware
  - mcollective::activemq_template
	- mcollective::activemq_memoryUsage
	- mcollective::activemq_storeUsage
	- mcollective::activemq_tempUsage
	- mcollective::activemq_console
	- mcollective::activemq_config
	- mcollective::activemq_confdir
	- mcollective::rabbitmq_confdir
	- mcollective::rabbitmq_vhost
	- mcollective::delete_guest_user

Features:
- Make the confdir configurable
- Added callerid param for mcollective::user
- Replace facts.yaml pattern with cron job
- Allow mcollective::collectives to be an array
- Added the following parameters to class mcollective:
  - client_package
	- confdir
	- rabbitmq_vhost
	- service_name
	- server_package
	- ruby_stomp_package
	- ssl_client_certs_dir

Bugfixes:
- Honor yaml_fact_path parameter in all the relevant places
- Use string for host_iteration titles in future parser, as integers are not
allowed as titles
