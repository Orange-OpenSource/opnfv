# Openstack Get Starting Installation

Openstack installation and configuration by Orange Labs.

## Introduction
This repo contains the tools and the scripts to install a full Openstack Juno over Ubuntu 14.04 with OpenDayLight Helium as SDN controller.

It aims to propose an **High Availability** deployment with **Bare Metal** provisioning.

The configuration is automatically done with **Puppet**, based on specific modules that rely on stackforge modules (see https://github.com/stackforge/?query=puppet).

To keep the module dependencies up to date (and to download modules automatically), we use **r10k**.

The storage is handled by **Ceph**.

The only thing you should do is to provide a valid **Hiera** configuration file.


## Status
* Puppet modules:
 * Mysql: OK,
 * Rabbit: OK,
 * Keystone: OK,
 * Glance: OK,
   * with ceph: OK,
 * Cinder: OK,
   * with ceph: OK,
 * Nova: OK,
   * with ceph: OK,
 * Neutron: OK,
* Bare metal provisioning: OK with Foreman)
* OpenDayLight: WiP
* High Availability: WiP

## Architecture
### Basic setup

In a lab configuration, to optimize resource usage:

* All nodes are *compute* and *storage*: they all contains nova-compute, neutron-compute and ceph OSD
* 2 nodes are also *controllers* containing KVM VMs for Openstack bricks, a DNS node and HAproxy
* 1 node is a network gateway to external networks

On each server, we have at least 4 networks:

* **br-int** : Integration bridge. Tag/untag VLAN for VM. veth for VM will be in this bridge.
* **br-vm** : Distributed bridge between compute nodes. Used to transport VM flows. In our case, we use the physical interface name **em5** as support for this bridge.
* **br-adm** : Administration bridge. This is used by controller part of OpenStack (which are in KVM) and other administrative tasks. In our case, we use the physical interface named **em3** as support for this bridge. This network needs an internet access through a default gateway to proceed installation.
* **br-storage**: Storage bridge, used by the ceph cluster. In our case, we use the physical interface name **em4** as support for this bridge.

The network server will also have one other bridge:

* **br-ex** : Bridge to communicate with external networks. In our case, we use the physical interface named **em2** as support for this bridge.

### How do we handle OpenStack functions
Each controller part of Openstack is created separatly in a KVM machine. So that it can easily be updated or redeployed.

Each KVM machine is automatically created by a script (opensteak-create-vm) and basic configuration comes through cloud-init. Openstack related configuration is handled by puppet.

### How do we provide HA
The work is still in progress, but we plan to use HAProxy in front of nodes, with VRRP IPs and weighted routes.
